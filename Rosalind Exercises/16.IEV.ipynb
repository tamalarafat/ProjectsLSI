    "IEV - Calculating Expected Offspring\n",
    "        For a random variable XX taking integer values between 1 and nn, the expected value of XX is E(X)=∑nk=1k×Pr(X=k)E(X)=∑k=1nk×Pr(X=k). The expected value offers us a way of taking the long-term average of a random variable over a large number of trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a motivating example, let XX be the number on a six-sided die. Over a large number of rolls, we should expect to obtain an average of 3.5 on the die (even though it's not possible to roll a 3.5). The formula for expected value confirms that E(X)=∑6k=1k×Pr(X=k)=3.5E(X)=∑k=16k×Pr(X=k)=3.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, a random variable for which every one of a number of equally spaced outcomes has the same probability is called a uniform random variable (in the die example, this \"equal spacing\" is equal to 1). We can generalize our die example to find that if XX is a uniform random variable with minimum possible value aa and maximum possible value bb, then E(X)=a+b2E(X)=a+b2. You may also wish to verify that for the dice example, if YY is the random variable associated with the outcome of a second die roll, then E(X+Y)=7E(X+Y)=7.\n",
