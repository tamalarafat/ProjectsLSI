    "        For positive integers aa and nn, aa modulo nn (written amodnamodn in shorthand) is the remainder when aa is divided by nn. For example, 29mod11=729mod11=7 because 29=11×2+729=11×2+7.\n",

    "Modular arithmetic is the study of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with respect to the modulo operation. We say that aa and bb are congruent modulo nn if amodn=bmodnamodn=bmodn; in this case, we use the notation a≡bmodna≡bmodn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two useful facts in modular arithmetic are that if a≡bmodna≡bmodn and c≡dmodnc≡dmodn, then a+c≡b+dmodna+c≡b+dmodn and a×c≡b×dmodna×c≡b×dmodn. To check your understanding of these rules, you may wish to verify these relationships for a=29a=29, b=73b=73, c=10c=10, d=32d=32, and n=11n=11.\n",

    "As you will see in this exercise, some Rosalind problems will ask for a (very large) integer solution modulo a smaller number to avoid the computational pitfalls that arise with storing such large numbers.\n",
